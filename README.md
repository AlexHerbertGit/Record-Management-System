# Record-Management-System
This is my Record Management System programmed in Javascript, the current iteration uses Node.js modules and File Sync to manage user inputs and outputs in the console. Records are stored in a JSON file that is updatable using the console inputs. Program menu has options for searching, updating and adding new records.
